## One Word, Many Languages
Have you ever wanted to hear a particular word translated into many languages? Maybe you are naming a product and all the english words you want to use have been taken! This is what happened to me. So I started a YouTube channel called One Word, Many Languages (OWML for short).

Hear your favourite words translated into many languages! If you would like other words translated, comment on my YouTube videos and I will add them to the word schedule.
